# Student Information System (SIS) - Updated for Dar Al-Hekma University

This project is an updated version of the Student Information System used by Dar Al-Hekma University. It aims to improve the universityâ€™s existing system by enhancing features, usability, and adapting it to current academic and administrative needs.

## Overview

The SIS helps students manage their academic profiles, registration, payments, and access important university resources. It supports smooth handling of course schedules, fee payments, and provides clear status updates for students.

## Usage

Once payments are confirmed by the accounting department, students can finalize their course registration seamlessly through the system.

## Features

- Fee tracking and payment status
- Access to academic resources and notifications

## Notes
